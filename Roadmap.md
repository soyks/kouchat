# Roadmap #

This is my current plan for the future of KouChat. Don't rely on this plan! It can and probably will change, but I thought some of you might be interested in the road ahead. No dates and priorities are set, and that's on purpose. It's done when it's done :)

If you have any suggestions, please use the issue tracker.

  * Multi-line messages ([issue 12](https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/issues/detail?id=12))
  * Make the system tray icon optional
  * Clickable links in the about dialog
  * Direct TCP/IP connection to users
  * Switch to json as transport format
  * Point to point encryption ([issue 4](https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/issues/detail?id=4))
  * Send all files in folder
  * Only see users in specified group/chat room
  * Improve console mode with ANSI, to get tab completion, colors and user list ([issue 26](https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/issues/detail?id=26))
  * Internationalization ([issue 27](https://code.google.com/p/kouchat/issues/detail?id=27))
